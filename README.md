# laboratory works NTU "KhPI" in C++/C

This repository contains my laboratory works from the first and second semesters, where I explored the fundamentals of programming using C++ and C. These works are a result of my learning journey through the **Fundamentals of Programming** course by [L.V. Ivanov](http://www.iwanoff.inf.ua/index_en.html).

### 1st Semester: C++ Basics
During the first semester, I focused on learning the basics of C++ by implementing various tasks and algorithms. This foundational work included:
- Understanding variables, data types, and control structures.
- Implementing basic algorithms and problem-solving techniques.
- Gaining proficiency in C++ syntax and standard library usage.

### 2nd Semester: Advanced C++ and C
The second semester was dedicated to improving my C++ knowledge by diving into more advanced concepts such as:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Working with classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism to build more structured and modular code.
- **Algorithm Skills**: Enhancing problem-solving abilities with more complex algorithms and data structures.
- **Operating Systems**: Exploring the depths of computer systems through the **Operating Systems** subject, which involved understanding key OS concepts and implementing tasks in C on a Linux environment.

### Conclusion
This repository showcases my progress in mastering C++ and C, covering a wide range of topics from basic programming to advanced concepts and operating system fundamentals. For more information about the course, you can visit [L.V. Ivanov's website](http://www.iwanoff.inf.ua/index_en.html).
